## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [ ] At least one profile picture
[ ] Biography (at least 100 words)
An AI generated bio of my future self. I hope to achieve all those things but they are not real or true at present.
- [ ] Functional Contact Form

- [ ] "Projects" section

  [ ]Links to external sites.

 This portfolio aimed having a clean, modern design with functional features to showcase my developing skills. I included a profile picture to humanize the site and make it feel personal, alongside an AI-generated biography of my future. The contact form is fully functional, styled to match the site's overall layout, and allows visitors to easily reach me. The “Projects” section highlights some of my work - no links to external sites, Throughout the site, I attempted to use responsive design techniques and media queries to ensure the layout works smoothly on all screen sizes.

​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.

I included at least two (…almost. fully) developed web pages, structured with semantic HTML to enhance accessibility and readability. I followed responsive design principles to ensure the site looks and functions well on all devices, from desktops to mobile screens. The entire codebase is version controlled using Git, allowing for easy tracking of changes and collaboration if needed. For deployment, I used GitHub Pages, making the site publicly accessible with a clean URL and ensuring smooth updates. 

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)

​I did not include javascript but I included different styles for hover on some of the buttons. Still not fully conversant.

### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code: 

Available in images folder.
